# 🌍 COVID-19 Data Insights: A Visualization of Cases, Deaths, Vaccinations, and Testing Trends

This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven visual analysis of global COVID-19 trends from 2020 to 2024. It focuses on understanding regional disparities, testing efficiency, case fatality trends, vaccine effectiveness, hospital strain, and the impact of government policies through interactive Power BI dashboards and detailed analysis.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- To analyze COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, and testing trends globally.
- To assess the effectiveness of public health interventions and policies.
- To identify regional disparities in pandemic impact and healthcare responses.
- To visualize these trends using dynamic Power BI dashboards.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/)
- **Coverage**: 2020–2024, global data with country-level granularity
- **Attributes**: Cases, Deaths, Vaccinations, Testing, Stringency Index, GDP, Population

## 🧪 Key Analyses

1. **Regional & Demographic Impact**: Identified regions with highest cases, deaths, and testing rates. Observed disparities across continents.
2. **Testing Efficiency & CFR Trends**: Analyzed test positivity, testing coverage, and fatality patterns.
3. **Vaccine Effectiveness**: Correlation between GDP and vaccination rates, along with regional disparities.
4. **Hospital Strain Analysis**: ICU and hospitalization rates, seasonal patterns, regional strain trends.
5. **Government Policy Impact**: Analysis of lockdowns and restrictions using the Stringency Index.

## 📌 Key Insights

- High vaccination rates generally correlate with reduced fatality and case rates.
- Hospital strain and ICU admissions peaked between 2020 and 2022.
- Government policy stringency was more effective in the early pandemic phase.
- Testing efficiency improved over time, especially in developed regions.
- Data anomalies highlight the need for better reporting and equitable resource distribution.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Limitations

- Incomplete or missing data for some regions.
- Aggregated data could cause skewed insights.
- Distinction between blank and zero values required careful cleaning.
- Visual clutter had to be managed to maintain clarity.
